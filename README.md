# Spring Logger Lab 2

## Instruction

Define a new logging configuration that does the following:

1. Add a new file appender that outputs log statements to a file named
   `flatiron-spring-trace.log`.
2. Configure this appender with a pattern that follows these rules:
   1. Start each line with the log level, which should always be exactly 3
      characters and truncate from the beginning:
      1. Hint: the modifier to truncate from the beginning is: `.-<num-chars>`
   2. Next, each line should have the thread in the following format:
      `[THREAD:main]`
   3. Next, each line should have the fully qualified class name in full.
   4. Next each line should have a new line character.
   5. Next each line should have two tabs (hint: tab is a special character
      `\t`).
   6. Next each line should have the actual message passed into the logger.
   7. Next each line should have another new line character.
3. Configure your logging so that only classes in the package
   `com.flatiron.spring` use this new appender.

The output in `flatiron-spring-trace.log` should look something like this:

```java
